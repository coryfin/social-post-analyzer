The first leak came just before the Democratic Convention angering Bernie voters which caused troubles unifying the party. Then it was a constant drip drip drip throughout the general election process. This required the Clinton campaign to be on the defensive and could not concentrate on fine tuning her message. The media reported continually on the leaked emails and never covered the issues or solution put out by the candidates. It was all gotcha journalism. The only way I was able to hear her message was listening to her speeches. Whether it was climate control creating new jobs, infrastructure policy funded through taxes on higher incomes creating new jobs, college affordability and job training,... There were so many worthwhile policies put forth, but the media only covered the side show and did not cover what she put forth. The only things the media covered on her speeches was when she highlighted Trump's faults. So why doesn't the media state that the Russian intrusion did impact the election. I would be interested how many hours of news coverage was done on the leaked DNC and Podesta emails vs the policies put forth. The leaked emails from the Russian hack also gave Trump and his campaign talking points to exaggerate or misinterpret of which the media then covered as if it was real news. How is this not benefiting Trump campaign and not impacting the election? How can the media say that the Russian hack did not lead to Clinton not winning the election?", "created_time": "2016-12-12T14:10:36+0000"}], "comment_count": 25, "id": "219367258105115_1391603904214772"}, {"reaction_counts": {"LOVE": 1, "ANGRY": 4, "LIKE": 17}, "reactions": [{"name": "Kathy Suclin", "id": "648627518543099", "type": "LIKE"}, {"name": "Jessica Miller", "id": "785454754843927", "type": "LIKE"}, {"name": "Rebwar Ahmed", "id": "1607434716171804", "type": "LIKE"}, {"name": "Stevie Joseph", "id": "402825389868838", "type": "ANGRY"}, {"name": "Sadiq Nuhu Jallah", "id": "1407594732852096", "type": "LIKE"}, {"name": "Jim Wes Wes", "id": "1405112333124661", "type": "LIKE"}, {"name": "Dale Scott", "id": "739540629423637", "type": "LIKE"}, {"name": "\u0645\u0644\u0643\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0648\u0627\u0636\u0639", "id": "173650893108060", "type": "LIKE"}, {"name": "Joshua Durham", "id": "10152370281901061", "type": "LIKE"}, {"name": "Donna Miller Stello", "id": "689903214417496", "type": "LIKE"}, {"name": "Renee Bettez Mulligan", "id": "10202972011354971", "type": "ANGRY"}, {"name": "Khelito Zhimo Jami", "id": "1540808512872194", "type": "LIKE"}, {"name": "Monica Lyons", "id": "926013514125173", "type": "LIKE"}, {"name": "Daruuosh Soltan", "id": "900715036605412", "type": "LIKE"}, {"name": "Candice Keane", "id": "10203385384251509", "type": "LIKE"}, {"name": "Sandra Matera", "id": "286705838176180", "type": "ANGRY"}, {"name": "Anup Biswas", "id": "1587904418150118", "type": "LIKE"}, {"name": "Seifa Besrat", "id": "305729893126536", "type": "LIKE"}, {"name": "Nasir Sinien", "id": "1103768339684763", "type": "LIKE"}, {"name": "Leo King Leo", "id": "1659619850935788", "type": "LIKE"}, {"name": "Jenet Chepnda", "id": "1161347023884069", "type": "LOVE"}, {"name": "Kathy Stieber", "id": "10203522320922979", "type": "ANGRY"}, {"name": "Virginia Mitchell", "id": "715519548498964", "type": "LIKE"}, {"name": "Lise Duval", "id": "10152580378467893", "type": "ANGRY"}, {"name": "Caroline Talley", "id": "10203823255605544", "type": "LOVE"}], "message": "\"I think his attitude, his support for Israel is clear,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says about Donald J.

Pakistan is doing all kinds of those atrocities that a sane human mind cannot imagine,\" Naela told ANI. Stating that Pakistan is committing this genocide of the Baloch people with the full support of China as a form of 'ethnic cleansing', Naela said: \"The International Day of Human Rights was announced by the UN, but it is silent despite the atrocities and the level of genocide going on in Balochistan by the Pakistan Army and the Pakistani establishment. It's like a kind of situation where Baloch people have no rights that even your animals have.\" Buttressing her claims, the Baloch activist said, \"We have found more than 100 mass graves with more than 100 bodies in each, and doctors say they were alive when they were buried in those mass graves.\" They are burning Baloch villages and towns, it is a situation that no human heart can see and keep silent, she said, adding, \"But we are surprised and we are worried about the legal status of the UN now.\" She said that what is going on in a part of the world (Balochistan) is very much needed for connecting the Indian Ocean to the Central Asia; it's very much needed to be a route; it's very much needed for people's trade; and it's very much needed for the economic corridor (China-Pakistan Economic Corridor-CPEC). \"It is not a corridor; it is our home; it is a corridor for outsider; it is a corridor for occupiers and passersby; for us it is our home,\" she said. Naela said, \"The United Nations is blind and has closed its ears and mouth to what?s going on in this part of the world. And this is the seventieth 10th December that the Baloch people are facing, and the UN is silent. So, on this day, on the behalf of the Baloch nation, on this International Day of Human Rights, we demand the UN to please wake up and to please listen what is going on in Balochistan.\" Yes, you are the United Nations, a nation of 40 million people, one of the biggest nations on the earth is living without a country and needs you, said Naela, adding: \"A nation is going to be finished from the face of the earth, so we are an endangered nation.\" \"You (UN) work for the endangered species and animals, the world is working for them but what if we are endangered? So, the Baloch nation is going to be finished from the face of the earth and the U.N. is silent and the international community is silent, it's a very-very worrisome situation for us,\" she added. Meanwhile, to mark International Human Rights Day on December 10 (Saturday), Baloch political activists across world, including the UK, Canada, Australia, South Korea, Germany and many other European nations held protests against the atrocities committed by the Pakistan establishment on their people back home. It was on December 10, 1948, when the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In Geneva (Switzerland), Abdul Bugti of Baloch Republican Party said, \"The objective of the protest demonstration is to highlight the abuses in Balochistan on this occasion. There are massive human rights abuses going on in Balochistan by the 'terror-state' of Pakistan, its army and intelligence agencies.\" \"They are engaged in killing and enforced disappearances of Baloch civilians on daily basis.

He could have gone a bit further and admitted he screwed up royally, or \u201cbig league\u201d as Donald Trump would say, but the mainstream media were still shocked their messiah fessed up to not being flawless.\n\n\u201cThe ability of ISIL to not just mass inside of Syria, but then to initiate major land offensives that took Mosul, for example, that was not on my intelligence radar screen,\u201d Obama said during an interview with CNN. Perhaps the birth of ISIS wasn\u2019t on Obama\u2019s screen because he was, allegedly, very prone to skipping security meetings and didn\u2019t want to know what was really going on in Syria.\n\nAlmost exactly two years ago, Barack Obama referred to ISIS as the \u201cJV team.\u201d Since then, tens of thousands have been killed or have fled for their lives from the Islamic State militants and the caliphate they have been allowed to create.\n\nCongress discovered CENTCOM Military officials altered their intelligence reports to depict a more positive outlook on the battle against terrorism, Breitbart notes. Burying your head in the sand while lying to We the People are not the earmarks of either a patriot or a good leader.\n\n\u201cFrom the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the United States Central Command\u2019s most senior intelligence leaders manipulated the command\u2019s intelligence products to downplay the threat from ISIS in Iraq,\u201d Representative Mike Pompeo said to reporters after the CENTCOM intelligence report information became public.\n\nThe interim report was drafted by a task force created by the House Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee, and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.\n\nThe report found \u201cwidespread dissatisfaction\u201d among Central Command intelligence analysts, who argued their superiors were doctoring their assessments of efforts to defeat ISIS.\n\n\u201cIntelligence products approved by senior CENTCOM leaders typically provided a more positive depiction of U.S. anti-terrorism efforts than was warranted by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the intelligence community,\u201d a media release about CENTCOM report said.\n\nThe mainstream media largely ignored or tried to excuse Obama\u2019s altered intelligence report antics. Mike Pompeo has been tapped to become Donald Trump\u2019s CIA director, so, thankfully, the rose-colored terrorism reports are about to come to an end.\n\nHowever, the fact that Obama missed the true threat imposed by ISIS is only half the story. The \u201cwhy\u201d matters too.

Cathy McMorris Rodgers to lead the Department of the Interior. She has a troubling track record of actively undermining our environment.\n\n\u201cThe Secretary of the Interior is charged with stewardship of most of our nation\u2019s public lands, including national parks and wildlife refuges. The person who fills this role sets the tone for relationships with tribal governments and bears crucial responsibility for protecting wildlife, including endangered species.\n\n\u201cCongresswoman McMorris Rodgers\u2019s environmental record is frankly terrible.  She has repeatedly voted against the environment and in favor of special interests who want to use public lands and resources for private gain.  She has supported rollbacks to critical environmental protections for our nation\u2019s forests, voted to undercut the president\u2019s authority to protect public lands as national monuments in Western states, and voted against restricting taxpayer hand-outs to companies that profit from oil and gas extracted from federal public lands.\n\n\u201cOn wildlife, McMorris Rodgers has stood in the way of species recovery. She has co-sponsored legislation to remove all federal protections for the endangered gray wolf. She is also one of the most vocal opponents of restoring the lower Snake River, long highlighted by biologists as the most promising tool for recovering endangered wild salmon populations in the Pacific Northwest.\n\n\u201cHer congressional voting record shows lots of evidence that McMorris Rodgers will serve the interests of corporations that seek to plunder resources from public lands, rather than acting on behalf of all Americans to safeguard our wild lands and natural treasures. President-elect Trump should retract this announcement, or the Senate should reject this nomination. If not, and if McMorris Rodgers attempts to carry out her anti-environment agenda, Earthjustice and its attorneys will see her in court.\u201d", "created_time": "2016-12-09T18:04:00+0000"}, {"from": {"name": "Katie Maleckar", "id": "10202975330718857"}, "id": "1387906427917853_1387975297910966", "message": "Conservation??????

Only a fool would believe Trump would draw a sharp, bright line between his personal and family financial interests and the interests of the nation. Since the election, he\u2019s demonstrated in both word and deed that he intends to fully monetize the presidency to benefit his companies, integrate his children into consequential government decisions, and put the bully in the bully pulpit.\nThose things were expected as part of the skeezy, venal radiation Trump gives off when it comes to his business dealings. Like many, I still expect that Trump is going to make Americans aware of the phrase \u201cemoluments clause\u201d like no one else in history.\nWe have a speaker of the House who until Trump was an admitted devotee of Ayn Rand. We have members of the Senate and the House who have railed for not years, or decades, but for generations against crony capitalism, government intervention in markets.\nSome corporations perhaps believe that he\u2019ll be business-as-usual, a transactional politician who plays nicely in the D.C. lobbying ecosystem despite his public bluster. They\u2019re wrong, of course. Trump and Steve Bannon, in particular, see the business class as the enemy. They see corporate CEOs as either peers or foes, and the peers fall under the Machiavellian \u201cenemies closer\u201d rule. Those confident they can buy, flatter, or avoid Trump are playing a game, unlike anything America\u2019s corporate world has seen before.\nRemember, once Trump has WON a feud (or an election) the normal rules of politics would be to return to the status quo ante. Not Trump. He continues to attack, belittle, and torture his victims long after there\u2019s any political utility to it. It will be the same with his thug populism and attacks on American businesses. The fight won\u2019t be over; capitulation isn\u2019t enough. He demands abject humiliation. \nThis behavior isn\u2019t without precedent in the hands of authoritarians. In the early days of Vladimir Putin\u2019s reign, a number of billionaire oligarchs like Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev of the massive Yukos oil concern crossed the Russian strongman. Putin first turned the Russian media and propaganda machine against the men, then the power of the Russian courts, which\u2014handily enough\u2014he controlled. At first, this was greeted as a populist new leader draining the swamp (where have I heard that lately?) and teaching the hated oligarch class a stiff lesson. Take the reign of V. Putin for an example - The already shaky post-Soviet commitment to reducing the terrible power of the state over the lives of its citizens was swiftly forgotten and as Putin\u2019s attacks on his enemies were backed up by a media dedicated to his aggrandizement and protections, many bowed to the inevitable Putin stopped reporters from reporting on his actions, but his image as a celebrity despot was carefully cultivated and polished. A rigid core of Putin voters loves him as the man who Made Russia Great Again. Sound familiar?\nWe\u2019re not there yet, but the signs are clear enough, even before Trump has taken the oath of the most powerful office in the land. Political, corporate, and media leaders who refuse to see\u2014and speak out about\u2014what\u2019s coming, what\u2019s etched in the behavior and character of this man need to see and speak up at the warning signs.", "created_time": "2016-12-09T16:30:25+0000"}, {"from": {"name": "Sandi Bartlett", "id": "10201766464310053"}, "id": "1387591761282653_1387594141282415", "message": "CNN I hope.
